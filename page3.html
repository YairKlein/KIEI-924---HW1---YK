        <h4>Ski Equipment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/top-skis-gear-3009334">Skis:</a>
              An overview of top ski brands to help you narrow down the options.
              Tip: Staff at rental outlets can help you get the right size of ski,
              or you can consult a ski sizing chart to find a suitable size range for your height and weight.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-fit-ski-boots-3009319">Ski Boots:</a>
                Learn the basics of fitting ski boots. Boots for beginners should be supportive and comfortable.
                You don't need high-performance when you're learning to ski.</li>

                You don't poles to learn to ski, but most adults like to start with them.
                Kids generally shouldn't use poles until they're ready for proper turning (not snow plowing).</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/ski-goggles-3009330">Goggles:</a>
                When it's snowing you can't ski without goggles, and many skiers like to wear them for sun protection, too.
                Learn about different types and brands of goggles, including over-the-glasses goggles, for those who wear eyeglasses.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ski-snowboard-helmets/b?ie=UTF8&node=11030590011&tag=aboutcom02thoughtco-20">Helmet:</a>
                You gotta wear a helmet to ski safe, so you better start shopping.
                Helmets are comfortable and keep you warm, in addition to helping protect you from serious injury.
                You can go high-tech by accessorizing your helmet with Bluetooth headphones.</li>

        <h4>Ski Clothing</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-dress-in-layers-3009325">Base Layer:</a>
                Learn how to layer your clothing for comfort and protection.
                The base layer, like long underwear and turtlenecks, should be made of performance fabric, not cotton.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/slp/mens-ski-sweaters/4vugwj49uhrp43z?tag=aboutcom02thoughtco-20">Sweaters:</a>
                Shop for ski sweaters and other "mid layers" that offer lightweight performance.
                <li><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/top-ski-socks-3008740">Socks:</a>
                Check out these high-performance socks from some leading brands.
                Bulky wool or cotton socks are the last thing you want between your feet and boots.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/top-mens-ski-jackets-3009329 ">Jackets:</a>
                 Your ski jacket jacket is a critical piece of equipment.
