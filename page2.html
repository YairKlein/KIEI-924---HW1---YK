        <h3>Downhill Skiing</h3>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most popular form of skiing, downhill or "alpine" skiers ski down mountains and strive to ski well on challenging terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Downhill skis vary in length and shape depending on the height of the skier and the type of snow they will be skiing.
          Downhill skiers use ski poles, and their boots are reinforced plastic that steadily hold the foot to the ski.

        <h3>Backcountry Skiing</h3>
        <p>From rolling hills to jagged high peaks, skiers seek out backcountry terrain for solitude, freedom and untracked powder.
          There has been a recent surge in the popularity of backcountry skiing due to open-gate policies at ski resorts, Big Mountain Freestyle Ski Films, rising lift ticket prices and advances in ski equipment.</p>

        <h3>Freestyle Skiing</h3>
        <p>Freestyle skiing is a type of skiing where skiers do tricks or jumps.
          From skiing on halfpipes to getting air and soaring over jumps (and then doing tricks in the air), freestyle skiers also ski moguls.
          While skiing down close set moguls, freestyle skiers race through moguls and then ski over a jump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most freestyle skiers ski in normal downhill ski boots, yet some freestyle skiers use twin tip skis, which allow them to perform jumps and ski through moguls well.
          Other freestyle skiers use snow blades, which are extremely small skis.
